      <h3><strong>Ninja Coin Collector (2018)</strong><br></h3>
      <a href="https://aleandrovalencia.github.io/NinjaCoinCollector/" title="Runs in web browser">Play Now!</a>
      <p>A game idea I had in University as part of an assignment where we had to come up with a game idea every day
        for 52 days
        (found <a target="_blank" href="https://streak.club/p/18716/ninja-coin-collector-by-aleandrovalencia">here</a>).
        Designed for mobile, tap the screen to travel that direction while collecting as many coins as possible and
        dodging obstacles. The boots power up makes you go faster and the green arrow power up lets you change
        direction immediately. Made in Unity using 2D sprites.</p>

      <p>A game I made for my niece's birthday. She liked playing Sonic Dash so I thought I'd try make something
        similar. Use the arrow keys to change lanes and jump over obstacles. Made in Unity using 2D sprites.<br>

      <h3>Global Game Jam<br></h3>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/users/yes10" title="Global Game Jam - Aleandro Valencia">Visit
        page</a>
      <p>I made some games as part of the Global Game Jam! I've been attending the event since 2015. I started off not
        really knowing what I was doing but over the years I was able to practise my skills and make some cool games.</p>
        <h3>Helping Hands (2020)<br></h3>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/helping-hands-9" title="Helping Hands (Awesome Racoon Game) download page">Download</a>
        <p>The theme this year was <b>REPAIR</b>. I teamed up with some Uni mates to create a game where you play as a Racoon who is just trying to help out 
          society by fixing broken objects with some trash. Don't get spotted by the humans though, they are not too fond of seeing Racoons on the street unless
          it is nearby some rubbish (hint hint). You also might see a random easter egg if you explore the map. <br>

        <h3>Mission Anti-Transmission (2018)<br></h3>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/mission-anti-transmission" title="Mission Anti-Transmission download page">Download</a>
        <p>The theme this year was <b>TRANSMISSION</b>. We made a
          tower defence game within the lungs of a cricket player (our random wikipedia page as part of the diversifier
          Special:Random). Within the game is a minigame which is like a chemistry test for the diversifier Inception.
          The final diversifier was to include an easter egg which is a trophy of the cricket trophy from the wikipedia
          page we got.<br>

        <h3>Web Surfer Dude (2017)<br></h3>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/web-surfer-dude" title="Web Surfer Dude download page">Download</a>
        <p>The theme this year was <b>WAVES</b> so we interpreted this as web
          surfing. Web Surfer Dude is a 2-player vs game where players must collect tokens which act as currency to
          spawn units to attack the opponents base (either their email or firewall). Troops include virus, bot,
          creepypasta, spam and trojan horse. If you play as the protagonist, collected tokens turn into good websites,
          otherwise they turn into dodgy websites.<br>

        <h3>No Gains No Pain (2016)<br></h3>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/no-gains-no-pain" title="No Gains No Pain download page">Download</a>
        <p>The theme this year was
          <b>RITUAL</b> so we obviously did a workout routine. This game composes of two scenes, the workout and the
          fight. Players workout one of their body parts by training at certain stations and this will help with the
          fight. Eg working out the legs will increase kick damage. In the middle of the fight, the player can collect
          needles which will instantly enlarge a limb depending on where the player stops it.<br>

        <h3>Rad Dad Redemption (2015)<br></h3>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/rad-dad-redemption-food-dad-ugly" title="Rad Dad Redemption download page">Download</a><br>
        <p>My first game jam. It's your child's birthday party. The clown you hired has just informed you that he is
          unable to make it. The theme: <b>"What do we do now?"</b>As a dad you must become the clown and feed the
          masses.
          Rad Dad Redemption is a top down shooter (survival horror?) with optional multiplayer featuring Hairy
          Godfather. There was a miscommunication as I thought there would be multiple children sprites but we ended up
          using the same one for angry and they just transform into different children...<br>
