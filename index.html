      <p>A game idea I had in University as part of an assignment where we had to come up with a game idea every day
        for 52 days
        (found <a target="_blank" href="https://streak.club/p/18716/ninja-coin-collector-by-aleandrovalencia">here</a>).
        Designed for mobile, tap the screen to travel that direction while collecting as many coins as possible and
        dodging obstacles. The boots power up makes you go faster and the green arrow power up lets you change
        direction immediately.<br>
        My niece's birthday was coming up so I thought I'd make the game for her.<br></p>

      <p>A game I made for my niece's birthday. She liked playing Sonic Dash so I thought I'd try make something
        similar. Use the arrow keys to change lanes and jump over obstacles.<br></p>

      <li>Global Game Jam</li>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/users/yes10" title="Global Game Jam - Aleandro Valencia">Visit
        page</a>
      <p>I made some games as part of the Global Game Jam! I've been attending the event since 2015. I started off not
        really knowing what I was doing but over the years I was able to practise my skills and make some cool games.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mission Anti-Transmission (2018)</li>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/mission-anti-transmission" title="Mission Anti-Transmission download page">Download</a>
        <p>This year I worked in a new group to previous years. The theme this year was <b>TRANSMISSION</b>. We made a
          tower defence game within the lungs of a cricket player (our random wikipedia page as part of the diversifier
          Special:Random). Within the game is a minigame which is like a chemistry test for the diversifier Inception.
          The final diversifier was to include an easter egg which is a trophy of the cricket trophy from the wikipedia
          page we got.<br>

          <br>I mainly did the art assets using Adobe Photoshop.<br></p>
        <li>Web Surfer Dude (2017)</li>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/web-surfer-dude" title="Web Surfer Dude download page">Download</a>
        <p>My favorite game jam game I made so far. The theme this year was <b>WAVES</b> so we interpreted this as web
          surfing. Web Surfer Dude is a 2-player vs game where players must collect tokens which act as currency to
          spawn units to attack the opponents base (either their email or firewall). Troops include virus, bot,
          creepypasta, spam and trojan horse. If you play as the protagonist, collected tokens turn into good websites,
          otherwise they turn into dodgy websites.<br>
          I really liked the game design idea of multitasking (inspired by TWEWY)<br>

          <br>I took the lead programming this project.</p>
        <li>No Gains No Pain (2016)</li>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/no-gains-no-pain" title="No Gains No Pain download page">Download</a>
        <p>This one was pretty comedic. I was still in the process of honing my Unity skills. The theme this year was
          <b>RITUAL</b> so we obviously did a workout routine. This game composes of two scenes, the workout and the
          fight. Players workout one of their body parts by training at certain stations and this will help with the
          fight. Eg working out the legs will increase kick damage. In the middle of the fight, the player can collect
          needles which will instantly enlarge a limb depending on where the player stops it.<br>

          <img src="Images/ngnp2.PNG" alt="No Gains No Pain Combat Gameplay">
          <br>I programmed the combat.</p>
        <li>Rad Dad Redemption (2015)</li>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/rad-dad-redemption-food-dad-ugly" title="Rad Dad Redemption download page">Download</a>
        <p>My first game jam. It's your child's birthday party. The clown you hired has just informed you that he is
          unable to make it. The theme: <b>"What do we do now?"</b>As a dad you must become the clown and feed the
          masses.
          Rad Dad Redemption is a top down shooter (survival horror?) with optional multiplayer featuring Hairy
          Godfather. There was a miscommunication as I thought there would be multiple children sprites but we ended up
          using the same one for angry and they just transform into different children...<br>

          <img src="Images/rdr2.PNG" alt="Rad Dad Redemption Gameplay">
          <br>I wasn't very confident in Unity at the time, so I just did some of
          the sprites made in Adobe Flash and Photoshop.</p>
      </ul>
