  <h2>Games I made</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><h3>District Underground</h3></li>
  <p>My capstone project at Media Design School as part of team Danger Noodle. I worked on programming the character and the camera.</p>

  <li><a href="https://aleandrovalencia.github.io/NinjaCoinCollector/">Ninja Coin Collector</a> (2018)</li>
  <p>A game idea I had in University as part of an assignment where we had to come up with a game idea every day for 52 days 
    (found <a href="https://streak.club/p/18716/ninja-coin-collector-by-aleandrovalencia">here</a>).<br>
    My niece's birthday was coming up so I thought I'd make the game for her.</p>

  <li><a href="https://aleandrovalencia.github.io/EndlessRunner2D/">Endless Runner 2D</a> (2017)</li>
  <p>A game I made for my niece's birthday. She likes to play Sonic Dash so I thought I'd try make something similar.<br>

  <li> <a href="https://aleandrovalencia.github.io/SpaceGame">Space Game</a> </li>
  <p>I used this to test the Unity web player on github.io.</p>
  
  <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/users/yes10">Global Game Jam page</a> </li>
  <p>I made some games as part of the Global Game Jam!</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/mission-anti-transmission">Mission Anti-Transmission</a> (2018)</li>
      <p>My latest escapade where I worked in a new group to previous years.<br>
        I did the art using Adobe Photoshop<br></p>

      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/web-surfer-dude">Web Surfer Dude</a> (2017)</li>
      <p>Probably the Game Jam game that I'm most proud of.<br>
        I really liked the game design idea of multitasking (inspired by TWEWY)<br></p>

      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/no-gains-no-pain">No Gains No Pain</a> (2016)</li>
      <p>This one was pretty comedic. I was still in the process of honing my Unity skills.<br></p>

      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/rad-dad-redemption-food-dad-ugly">Rad Dad Redemption</a> (2015)</li>
      <p>My first game jam. I wasn't very confident in Unity so I just did some of the sprites made in Adobe Flash.</p>
    </ul>
